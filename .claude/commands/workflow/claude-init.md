# Claude Init

## Task

Initialize and generate comprehensive CLAUDE.md documentation with deep project research using ULTRATHINK methodology.

## Instructions

**ULTRATHINK deeply about the current project structure, dependencies, build tools, testing frameworks, and development patterns to generate a comprehensive 200-line CLAUDE.md that captures essential development best practices for this specific codebase.**

## Approach

1. **Project Discovery Phase**
   - Examine all configuration files (package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Analyze directory structure and architectural patterns
   - Identify primary programming languages and frameworks
   - Discover build tools, package managers, and deployment methods

2. **Development Workflow Analysis**
   - Understand how the application is built and run
   - Identify testing frameworks and test execution patterns
   - Examine CI/CD configurations and deployment processes
   - Review linting, formatting, and code quality tools

3. **Best Practices Research**
   - Analyze existing code patterns and conventions
   - Identify common libraries and utility functions
   - Understand error handling and logging approaches
   - Review documentation standards and commenting patterns

4. **CLAUDE.md Generation**
   - Create comprehensive project overview
   - Document essential commands for development workflow
   - Capture framework-specific best practices
   - Include debugging and troubleshooting guidance
   - Add context management recommendations
   - Document testing strategies and quality assurance

## Output Requirements

Generate a focused 200-line CLAUDE.md that includes:
- Project type and technology stack summary
- Essential development commands and workflows
- Framework-specific best practices and patterns
- Common pitfalls and debugging strategies
- Testing approach and quality assurance guidelines
- Context management for Claude Code sessions

## Methodology

Use systematic analysis with multiple tool calls to gather comprehensive project information, then synthesize findings into actionable development guidance that will help Claude Code work more effectively with this specific codebase.
