# Agent Engineering Guide

## Overview

Agent engineering represents the cutting-edge approach to AI interaction, moving beyond static prompts and context to dynamic, specialized AI agents that can handle complex workflows autonomously. This discipline focuses on designing, implementing, and orchestrating AI agents that can collaborate effectively to solve complex problems.

According to Andrew Ng's foundational work on agentic AI patterns, agent engineering encompasses four core design patterns that enable sophisticated autonomous AI behavior[^1].

## Core Agentic Design Patterns

### 1. Reflection Pattern

The Reflection pattern involves prompting an AI agent to critique and improve its own output iteratively, rather than producing a final result in one step[^1].

**Implementation:**
- Agent evaluates its own work
- Identifies potential flaws and areas for improvement
- Makes necessary adjustments through multiple iterations
- Continues until quality threshold is met

**Use Cases:**
- Code review and debugging
- Content editing and refinement
- Problem-solving validation
- Quality assurance workflows

### 2. Tool Use Pattern

Tool design and selection are critical for agent effectiveness. Agent-tool interfaces are as critical as human-computer interfaces, and using the right tool is often strictly necessary for task completion[^1].

**Key Principles:**
- Careful tool selection and integration
- Standardized agent-tool interfaces
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Tool capability discovery and matching

**Common Tools:**
- Web search and information retrieval
- Code execution environments
- Database and API interfaces
- File system operations
- Specialized domain tools

### 3. Planning Pattern

The Planning pattern enables agents to formulate and execute multi-step plans to achieve complex objectives, dynamically adapting workflows based on goals and constraints[^1].

**Components:**
- Goal decomposition into sub-tasks
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Dependency management
- Dynamic replanning based on results
- Progress monitoring and adjustment

**Applications:**
- Project management workflows
- Complex problem-solving scenarios
- Multi-step data processing pipelines
- Coordinated multi-agent activities

### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern

This pattern involves several AI agents working together, each with specific roles, enabling specialization and collaborative problem-solving for complex projects[^1][^2].

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Task specialization and expertise distribution
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Fault tolerance and redundancy
- Scalable problem-solving approach

## Agent Types and Architectures

### Custom Agents

Custom agents provide specialized functionality with isolated contexts and surgical tool selection, eliminating token bloat and manual orchestration[^3].

**Key Features:**
- Automatic activation based on task description
- No CLAUDE.md inheritance (prevents context pollution)
- Custom tool selection and configuration
- Portable across projects via single .md file

**Weight Classifications:**
- **Lightweight agents**: Under 3k tokens - Low initialization cost
- **Medium-weight agents**: 10-15k tokens - Moderate initialization cost  
- **Heavy agents**: 25k+ tokens - High initialization cost

### Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

Multi-agent systems employ structured collaboration and task distribution, where multiple agents work together, each contributing unique capabilities to achieve common goals[^4].

**Orchestrator-Worker Pattern:**
A lead agent coordinates specialized sub-agents operating in parallel, enabling exploration of complex, open-ended tasks by decomposing queries and searching simultaneously[^2].

**Benefits:**
- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on specific tasks
- **Fault Tolerance**: System remains resilient if one agent fails
- **Scalability**: Parallel processing enables faster completion
- **Expertise Distribution**: Different agents bring unique skills

### Event-Driven Multi-Agent Patterns

Four key interaction patterns define how agents communicate and collaborate[^5]:

1. **Orchestrator-Worker**: Central coordinator manages distributed workers
2. **Hierarchical Agent**: Layered authority and responsibility structure
3. **Blackboard**: Shared knowledge space for agent coordination
4. **Market-Based**: Competitive bidding and resource allocation

## Implementation Frameworks

### Leading Frameworks

**AutoGen**: Specialized in planning and multi-agent collaboration workflows[^1]
**LangChain**: Supports reflection, tool use, and ReAct patterns[^1]
**LangGraph**: Provides rich multi-agent solution building capabilities[^4]
**Crew AI**: Focuses on team-based agent coordination[^4]

### Framework Selection Criteria

- **Task Complexity**: Match framework capabilities to problem requirements
- **Agent Count**: Consider scalability and coordination overhead
- **Tool Integration**: Evaluate available tool ecosystem
- **Development Experience**: Consider learning curve and documentation quality

## Design Principles

### Performance Optimization

**Token-First Design:**
- Create focused, single-purpose agents initially
- Carefully engineer token requirements for initialization
- Prioritize efficiency over capability for frequent-use agents
- Design for chainability and multi-agent workflows[^3]

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- **Haiku + Lightweight Agent**: Frequent, simple tasks with minimal cost
- **Sonnet + Medium Agent**: Balanced approach for moderate complexity
- **Opus + Heavy Agent**: Complex analysis requiring maximum reasoning[^3]

### Agent Coordination Strategies

**Prompt Engineering for Orchestration:**
- "Teach the orchestrator how to delegate" with clear subtask descriptions
- Scale agent effort based on query complexity
- Use extended thinking mode for visible reasoning processes[^2]

**Performance Metrics:**
- Parallel tool calling can reduce research time by up to 90%
- Token usage explains 80% of performance variance[^2]

### Evaluation and Quality Assurance

**Evaluation Challenges:**
- Traditional step-by-step validation doesn't work well for multi-agent systems
- Focus on end-state evaluation rather than process validation
- Use LLM-based judging with specific rubric criteria[^2]

**Quality Assurance:**
- Implement robust error handling for stateful agents
- Design careful deployment strategies
- Maintain context management for long conversations

## Implementation Strategies

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with single-agent solutions
2. **Identify Specialization**: Determine where multiple agents add value
3. **Design Interfaces**: Create clear communication protocols
4. **Implement Coordination**: Add orchestration and management layers
5. **Test Integration**: Validate multi-agent workflows
6. **Monitor Performance**: Track effectiveness and optimize

### Common Use Cases

**Multi-agent systems are particularly effective for:**
- **Large Workloads**: Tasks requiring parallel processing
- **Complex Tasks**: Problems needing diverse expertise
- **Long-Running Processes**: Workflows spanning extended timeframes
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-perspective validation and review[^4]

## Advanced Workflows

### Context Management for Agents

**Challenges:**
- Multi-agent systems have emergent behaviors not specifically programmed
- Small changes to lead agents can unpredictably affect sub-agent behavior
- Success requires understanding interaction patterns, not just individual behavior[^4]

**Solutions:**
- Implement systematic context sharing protocols
- Design predictable agent interaction patterns
- Monitor emergent behaviors and adjust accordingly
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between agents

### Scalability Considerations

**Performance Scaling:**
- Lightweight agents enable fluid orchestration
- Heavy agents create bottlenecks in multi-agent workflows
- Balance specialized high-cost agents with efficient ones
- Implement "big.LITTLE" approach similar to CPU design[^3]

## Best Practices

### Agent Design Guidelines

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear purpose
2. **Clear Interfaces**: Define explicit input/output protocols
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust failure recovery mechanisms
4. **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and behavior
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear agent specifications and capabilities

### Multi-Agent Coordination
